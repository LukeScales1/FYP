# Final Year Project - B.Eng in Mechatronic Engineering
This Android app was built for the Final Year Project of my B.Eng in Dublin City University, Ireland. It was an exploration into the capabilities for ML-based image classification to innovate within the calorie-counting/diet-management applicaton industry. Namely, the application uses a retrained version of the MobileNets image classification model to perform this on Android - implemented with the lightweight TensorFlow Lite ML library. This was on the leading edge of mobile-based ML in 2017/18!

Please excuse the code quality: my project was based on the apps' functionality and on my research, so code quality lapsed in the rush to complete the project. It will be cleaned up eventually!
